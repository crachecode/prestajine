Prestajine
==========

Prestajine is a PrestaShop module that helps to generate images and thumbnails, directly by providing dimensions in the theme templates files, with no extra management from the administration panel. It is based on [Tajine](https://github.com/crachecode/tajine) which makes use of the [Intervention Image](https://github.com/Intervention/image) library.

## Features

Prestajine is an alternative to PrestaShop's original image manager.  
It allows you to create images and thumbnails at any dimensions, in a flexible way, without adding any plain background.
Desired images dimensions and parameters are to be defined directly in theme templates, while calling `<img src="...`.  
Resizing and cache are handled by Tajine.

**Currently it only works with products images and jpg.**

## Requirements

Prestajine requires PHP 5.6 or higher. It works with any version of PrestaShop. Its cache functionality can make use of Apache mod_rewrite, it also allows simpler image URLs, but Apache should not be mandatory. Tajine has not been tested with any other HTTP server though.

## Installation

 1. Download [this zip](https://packages.crachecode.net/prestajine/prestajine_latest.zip).

 2. Upload it from PrestaShop administration panel :  
 `Module and services` -> `Add a new module` -> `choose a file` -> `upload this module`

 3. Install it :  
 `Prestajine` -> `Install`

## Using Prestajine

Images at any dimension can then be accessed via HTTP.  
Simply call `<img src="{$base_dir}images/{$image.id_image}...` from theme templates following this syntax :

`{$base_dir}images/{$image.id_image}-[image-name].[width]x[height].[method].[quality].[upsize].jpg`

e.g. :  
* `{$base_dir}images/{$image.id_image}-product-1.1280x1024.basic.90.false.jpg` (width = 1280px, height = 1024px, basic method, jpg quality 90, no upsizing)  
* `{$base_dir}images/{$image.id_image}-product-1.1280x.false.jpg` (width = 1280px, no height specified, no upsizing)  
* `{$base_dir}images/{$image.id_image}-product-1.x1024.jpg` (height = 1024px, no width specified)  

### Parameters

| name      | value type              | description                                                               | default |
| ---       | ---                     | ---                                                                       | ---     |
| `width`   | integer                 | thumbnail width (in pixel)                                                | n/a     |
| `height`  | integer                 | thumbnail height (in pixel)                                               | n/a     |
| `method`  | `basic`, `fit` or `max` | resizing behaviour, see next paragraph                                    | `fit`   |
| `quality` | integer, `0` to `100`   | thumbnail quality, bigger is better but files are heavier                 | `85`    |
| `upsize`  | boolean                 | whether or not small images should be enlarged with larger thumbnail size | `true`  |
| `text`    | string                  | name of the image (for instance, name of the product)                     | n/a     |

**Method** can be set to :
* `basic` : image will be resized to the exact dimension, without keeping aspect ratio.
* `fit` : image will be resized to fit in specified width and / or height, keeping aspect ratio.  
If only one dimension is specified, unspecified dimension (width or height) will be adjusted depending on the other dimension.  
If both are specified, image will be cropped if necessary.
* `max` : image will be resized to fit in specified width and / or height, keeping aspect ratio, without cropping.

## Without mod_rewrite

You should still be able to use this module without mod_rewrite or with a HTTP server other than Apache. However the image URLs to call from the templates would be a bit different (and not so nice) :

   `{$base_dir}modules/prestajine/image.php?filename={$image.id_image}-product-1.jpg&width=[width]&height=[height]&method=[method]&quality=[quality]&upsize=[upsize]`

   e.g. :  
   * `{$base_dir}modules/prestajine/image.php?filename={$image.id_image}-product-1.jpg&width=1280&height=1024&method=basic&quality=90&upsize=false`  
   * `{$base_dir}modules/prestajine/image.php?filename={$image.id_image}-product-1.jpg&height=1024`

## Notes

Thumbnails are generated when visiting the page on which they are displayed.  
Generated thumbnails are saved as image files in `/img/prestajine` directory.  
When using mod_rewrite these files names are the same string as the URL provided for images generation. Therefore Apache doesn't even need to process PHP to display the cached version.  
They can safely be deleted to process the generation again.
